# Filled-Fields
This is a minecraft JAVA (datapack) mod. This is a DATA PACK, meaning you must drag the Filled Fields.zip into the Minecraft window.

This is a pretty basic "mod" and doesn't require fabric or Forge. (I believe this is compatible with minecraft 19.4)

# Licence
You are free to use this in anyway you like. You are allowed to edit and remaster the mod. You are free to credit me for the original idea.
