# Filled-Fields
This is a minecraft JAVA (datapack) mod. This is a DATA PACK, meaning you must drag the Filled Fields.zip into the Minecraft window.

This is a pretty basic "mod" and doesn't require fabric or Forge. (I believe this is compatible with minecraft 19.4)

# Installation
1. Open Minecraft Java.
2. Select Play (or use an exisitng world).
3. Start a new world and click on the "Data Packs" option.
4. Drag the Filled Fields.zip (NOT Filled Fields.data.zip) into the Minecraft window.
5. Confirm to use this data pack.
6. Drag the file to the right side of the screen. This is done by clicking the triangle on the icon for the file.
7. Click "Done".
8. Continue setting up the world, like entering a seed, changing settings, etc.
9. "Create New World".
10. If the data pack is correct and usable, the world will have it upon creation.
# Licence
You are free to use this in anyway you like. You are allowed to edit and remaster the mod. You are free to credit me for the original idea.
